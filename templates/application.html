    <h1>Derangement Problem</h1>

    <p>Recall a derangement problem that we discussed in the class. A derangement problem is also known as a hat-check problem in probabilistic theory. An instance of a hat-check problem contains \( n \) people where each person has his own hat. Particularly, Hat \( H_1 \) belongs to Person 1, Hat \( H_2 \) belongs to Person 2, \ldots, Hat \( H_n \) belongs to Person \( n \).</p>
